This is an MVC design pattern
- Models: Models
- View: The view, build or dist
- Controllers: Controllers
- Utilities/Services: Utils
- Utilities/Services specific to some models: Utils_MSU


NOTE always ensure that there is release date in your models as its part of the filter
or remove the middleware that has to do with release date from the model middile-ware
